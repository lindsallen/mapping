# mapping

This repo contains mapping projects that I've published on Medium and the Society of Actuaries.

**dc_restaurants**: <br>
- Contains code for Medium [Interactive Choropleth Map of Washington DC using Folium and Python](https://medium.com/@lindsayrallen1/interactive-choropleth-map-of-washington-dc-using-folium-and-python-2794708514d5) Article
- Objective is to demonstrate how to create an interactive choropleth map with a custom tooltip using DC restaurant data
- Code was originally built in Jupyter Notebooks, it has since been re-organized to reflect cookiecutter data science standards
- See branch "medium" for file structure that matches references in the article

**emergency_room_maps**: <br>
- Contains code for SOA Predictive Analytics presentation [The GISt - An Intro to Geospatial Analytics](https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/e-business/pd/events/2020/predictive-analytics-4-0/pd-2020-09-pas-session-012.pdf)
- There are two concepts demonstrated in this repo: 1) Application of interactive choropleth map to the CMS Data Entrepenuers file and 2) Creation of drivetime isochrones around New Jersey emergency rooms.
- All code is in Jupyter Notebooks and needs to be re-organized to reflect cookiecutter data science standards.
